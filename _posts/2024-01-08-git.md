# Moving a range of commits from one branch to another
This will replicate commits N to M in branch A into branch B.
```
git checkout branch-B
git rebase --onto branch-B <commit before X> Y
```

At this point we are in detached  HEAD state, the following gets us back to the HEAD of branch B
```
git rebase HEAD branch-B
```
